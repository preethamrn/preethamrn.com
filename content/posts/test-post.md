If you're seeing this post then that means the blog is working. I'll have a lot more (hopefully) great content coming soon. Just hold on.

Just so this post has a bit of actual content. Here's an image of my old website. It was littered with typos and dead links that I didn't notice for 2 years since I never really updated it.

And here's an image of the updated homepage. Looks a lot nicer. Lower quantity but higher quality projects. A unified layout across all my subpages. An integrated blog.

I've also set up sub-repositories for webapps that were originally built in this repo and redirect to those sub pages from the original links. For example the old link [preethamrn.com/algtrainer](/algtrainer) redirects to [https://www.preethamrn.com/cubing/algtrainer](https://www.preethamrn.com/cubing/algtrainer)

This helps reduce the package size of the main homepage and blog posts. I'll probably write up more about how I accomplished this later (for a hint, go to the [redirects](https://github.com/preethamrn/preethamrn.com/tree/master/content/redirects) directory in my repo).

A few things that I'm planning on doing is adding tags to all my posts, a comments section, better citation support[^1], smaller image sizes, and recommended posts. Hopefully I'll have all this set up before writing my first proper blog post.

In the meantime, consider following my RSS feed [here](https://www.preethamrn.com/feed.xml).
